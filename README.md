# Hashtag_recommendations_Twitter
Recommendation systems have been widely used at e-commerce websites to identify from a huge range of products the most appropriate ones for each user. The recommendation systems can be used in social networking sites like Twitter for hashtag recommendations which helps in effective categorizing of tweet and also helps in fetching better search results.

Twitter is one of the largest social networking and microblogging site that enables users to write and read messages called “tweets”. In Twitter following someone means the user who has followed a person can view his/her tweets in his/her timeline.Hashtag is mainly used as a means to share the mood of the user or to emphasize on a specific topic. Chris Messina, a social technology expert was the first person to use hashtag on Twitter. The popularity of Twitter has gained popularity in other social networks as well, e.g., Facebook and Instagram

In this project my aim is to develop a personalized hashtag recommendation system for Twitter users which motivates the people to use hashtags in their tweets. This recommendation also helps people to maintain a common hashtag for a particular event like #RioOlympics2016 instead of different hashtags like #Rio, #Olympics2k16 or #Rio2016 which represents same event of Rio Olympics 2016. The usage of different hashtags for the same event hinders the search results of a particular event.
